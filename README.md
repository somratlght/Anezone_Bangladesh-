# Anezone_Complete (Copyright-free Starter)
This is a starter ZIP for **Anezone** â€” a Bangladesh-focused marketplace.
All files and assets are original, lightweight, and copyright-free placeholders.

Structure:
- frontend/: static HTML (Bangla UI placeholders)
- backend/: Express server skeleton (placeholder keys)
- assets/: SVG logo, placeholder images (generated)
- docs/: integration & roadmap docs (Bangla)

How to run (basic):
1. Backend: `node backend/server.js` (requires Node.js)
2. Frontend: open `frontend/index.html` in browser or serve with a static server.

Replace API keys and implement production-grade features before going live.
